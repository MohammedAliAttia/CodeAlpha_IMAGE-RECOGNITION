# CodeAlpha_IMAGE-RECOGNITION
This task demonstrates classifying flower images using a tf. keras.Sequential model and loading data using tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory. It covers loading datasets off disk, identifying overfitting, and mitigating it. The task also demonstrates converting saved models to TensorFlow Lite for on-device machine learning..
